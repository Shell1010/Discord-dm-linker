# Discord-dm-linker

A tool designed to link dms between multiple users. Allows multiple users to send messages through a users account.

## Usage

Place token in main.py and run the selfbot. Add users with the `add` command, and remove users with the `remove` command. Start the DM Session with `start` and when users dm you, their messages will be sent to each other.
